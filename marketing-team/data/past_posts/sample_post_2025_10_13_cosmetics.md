Modern toners focus on hydration and pH balance rather than harsh astringency. Ingredients like glycerin, aloe, and low-percentage PHAs soothe and prepare skin for subsequent serums. Apply by patting into damp skin to lock in moisture and reduce friction. A hydrating toner improves product absorption and overall tolerability, making it a valuable step for many routines.
