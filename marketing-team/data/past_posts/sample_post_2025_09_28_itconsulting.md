AI workloads demand explicit service-level objectives (SLOs) and cost governance built into both model design and operations. Start by defining measurable SLOs that matter for users â€” latency percentiles for inference, success rates for critical model responses, and freshness for streaming or retraining pipelines. Pair these SLOs with concrete error budgets so teams understand acceptable risk and when to trigger mitigations.

Next, map cost thresholds to automated responses. Track per-model and per-endpoint spend with fine-grained attribution (tags, usage labels, or per-tenant metrics). When spend crosses a soft threshold, trigger automated optimizations: downscale replicas, reduce max tokens or batch size, enable caching layers, or route low-priority traffic to cheaper models. Reserve a hard threshold that surfaces to humans and pauses non-essential workloads for investigation.

Adopt transparency: surface cost and SLO metrics in dashboards used by engineering and product stakeholders so cost allocation and tradeoffs are visible. Combine telemetry from model serving (latency, requests, resource usage) with business signals (revenue, user engagement) to evaluate cost-benefit tradeoffs.

Finally, treat SLOs and cost controls as living artifacts: iterate them after migrations or traffic changes, and bake them into runbooks that describe automated remediation and escalation paths. With clear SLOs, automated cost guardrails, and visible attribution, AI workloads can be both performant and financially sustainable.
