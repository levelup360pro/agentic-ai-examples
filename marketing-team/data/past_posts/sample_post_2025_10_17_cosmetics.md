Refill programs reduce waste and make sustainable choices easier. Choosing refillable serum bottles or compact cartridges minimizes single-use packaging and encourages reuse. Keep empty containers clean and participate in brand return programs where available. Over time, small habits like choosing refills can significantly lower environmental impact without sacrificing the products you love.
