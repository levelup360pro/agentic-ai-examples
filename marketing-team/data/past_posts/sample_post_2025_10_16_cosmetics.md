The eye area needs gentle, targeted care. Choose lightweight creams or gels with peptides, niacinamide, or hyaluronic acid to hydrate and reduce the look of fine lines. Apply a pea-sized amount with a gentle tapping motion to avoid tugging. For puffiness, cool application and formulas with mild decongesting extracts can help. Sun protection around the orbital area is also important for long-term skin health.
