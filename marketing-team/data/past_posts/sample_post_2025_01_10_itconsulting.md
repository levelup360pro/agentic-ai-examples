Network design is foundational for secure, reliable migrations â€” invest in clear segmentation, predictable addressing, and shared infrastructure services. Start by defining environment boundaries (prod, staging, dev) and enforce segmentation between workloads with network policies or security groups. Centralize shared services like DNS, NTP, and authentication so applications can rely on consistent platform behavior.

Automate connectivity tests as part of the migration pipeline: verify route tables, firewall rules, VPN/DirectConnect links, and service endpoints before cutover. Include end-to-end telemetry checks (health endpoints, sample transactions) that validate not just low-level connectivity but application-level behavior under realistic scenarios.

Plan for migration-specific network challenges: IP renumbering, peering limitations, and latency impacts. Provide fallbacks such as temporary proxies or dedicated migration tunnels to reduce downtime. Document rollback procedures and include connectivity verification in post-migration smoke tests. With deliberate network design, automated checks, and robust fallback plans, migrations proceed with less friction and fewer surprises.
