Nighttime is prime repair timeâ€”pick restorative actives that work while you sleep. Lightweight retinoids encourage cell turnover and collagen support, but start with low concentrations and increase slowly to avoid irritation. Peptides and ceramides support steady improvement in texture without intolerances often associated with stronger actives. Use a hydrating mask or occlusive at night when extra moisture is needed. Keep routines simple: gentle cleanse, targeted serum, and replenishing moisturizer. Regular, gentle practice yields visible morning resiliency and improved skin quality over weeks.
