Cost visibility and chargeback models align engineering behavior with financial goals during large migrations. Start by instrumenting costs at the resource and service level: tag compute, storage, and network resources consistently and export per-service cost reports. Combine raw cost telemetry with usage metrics to understand which features or teams drive spend.

Use dashboards that show spend trends, forecasted monthly cost, and variance against budget. Implement automated alerts for runaway spend and integrate rightsizing reports into engineering workflows so optimization becomes routine. For cross-team accountability, adopt a lightweight chargeback or showback model that transparently attributes costs to teams or products, paired with pragmatic policies that reward cost-aware engineering.

Chargebacks should be educational, not punitive: provide recommendations (instance sizing, caching, storage tiers) and offer centralized engineering support for optimization. Include a monthly review ritual where finance and engineering align on spikes and planned changes. Over time, this creates a culture of cost-conscious design without slowing delivery â€” teams choose efficient patterns because they can see the impact.
