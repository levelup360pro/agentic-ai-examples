# Post Content

Facial oils can nourish without clogging when chosen by composition. Oils high in linoleic acid, such as squalane or certain seed oils, support barrier health and are less likely to congest pores. Use sparingly as the last step or mixed into moisturizer during dry seasons. Cold-pressed oils retain beneficial compounds but always test compatibility with your skin. For many, lightweight oils add supple radiance and comfort, especially in colder months.
