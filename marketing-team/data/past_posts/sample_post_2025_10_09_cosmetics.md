Vitamin C is a dependable antioxidant for brightening and protecting skin from oxidative stress. Prefer stable formats or well-formulated derivatives that reduce sensitivity. Start with lower concentrations and pair vitamin C with hydrating boosters such as hyaluronic acid to improve tolerance. Use in the morning under SPF to maximize protective effects. Over time, consistent use reduces dullness and helps even skin toneâ€”making vitamin C a worthwhile daily addition for many routines.
