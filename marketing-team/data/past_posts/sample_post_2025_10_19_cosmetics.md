Minimalist skincare focuses on a few effective, well-formulated essentials: cleanse, hydrate, protect. Reducing the number of actives lowers interaction risk and improves consistency. Build a core routine and add a single targeted treatment (like a retinoid or exfoliant) slowly. This approach yields steady, durable improvements without constant product turnover.
