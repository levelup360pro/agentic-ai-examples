Hyaluronic acid is a hydrating powerhouse that suits most skin types. Unlike heavy occlusives, it attracts water to the skinâ€™s surface, plumping fine lines and improving elasticity without feeling greasy. For best results, apply hyaluronic serums onto damp skin and seal with a moisturizer to retain moisture. Select lightweight serums with mixed molecular weights so both surface and deeper layers benefit. Fragrance-free, minimal formulations reduce irritation risk for sensitive skin. Small, consistent use improves softness and texture over weeks, making hyaluronic a mainstay in balanced routines. When combined with barrier-supporting ingredients like ceramides, the overall improvement in hydration and resilience is amplified.
