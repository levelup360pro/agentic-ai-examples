If your skin reacts easily, simplicity is essential. Start with fragrance-free, gentle cleansers and single-active serums to reduce the chance of irritation. Barrier-repair ingredients such as ceramides, niacinamide, and squalane strengthen resilience and calm redness when used consistently. Patch-test new products on the inner forearm for several days before applying to the face. Avoid harsh physical exfoliants and high concentration acids until the barrier is restored. If irritation appears, step back to a minimal routine focusing on hydration and repair, then reintroduce actives slowly. With patience and targeted care, sensitive skin often improves significantly in comfort and appearance.
