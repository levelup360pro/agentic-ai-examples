Establish cloud security baselines that become an integral part of every environment and deployment pipeline. Start with minimal but effective controls: network segmentation, secure default IAM roles with least privilege, centralized logging and monitoring, and mandatory encryption for storage and transit. Capture these baselines as templated infrastructure-as-code (IaC) modules and enforce them through automated checks during provisioning so new environments are secure by default.

Integrate continuous compliance scans into CI/CD pipelines — IaC linters, policy-as-code (e.g., guardrails for open S3 buckets or public subnets), and runtime security checks — to detect drift and prevent misconfiguration from being promoted. Pair automated detection with an escalation path that includes remediation guidance and a clear owner for fixes.

For high-risk workloads, add runtime protections such as workload identity (avoid long-lived keys), network micro-segmentation, and anomaly detection for unexpected behavior. Maintain a feedback loop: use incident postmortems and security telemetry to refine the baseline and adjust templates. Finally, balance control with developer velocity by providing self-serve, secure patterns and clear documentation — when security is both automated and usable, compliance becomes sustainable across teams.
