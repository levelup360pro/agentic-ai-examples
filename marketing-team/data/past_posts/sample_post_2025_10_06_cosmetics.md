Daily SPF is the most impactful step you can add to preserve skin health and reduce premature aging. UV exposure causes collagen breakdown and uneven pigmentation over time. Choose a broad-spectrum SPF 30 or higher and apply it as the final step in your morning routine. Modern formulas blend well under makeup and offer lightweight textures suitable for oily or dry skin. Reapply during prolonged outdoor exposure and choose water-resistant options when active. Pairing SPF with antioxidant serums gives extra defense against environmental stressors. Consistent daily use is simple and yields measurable long-term benefits.
