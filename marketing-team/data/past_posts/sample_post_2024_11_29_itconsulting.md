Blue/green deployments reduce cutover risk by maintaining two identical environments and switching traffic between them. The core advantage is a deterministic rollback path: if the new environment shows regressions, traffic can be switched back to the stable environment quickly. Automate traffic shifting with your load balancer or gateway and build health checks that gate the final cutover to avoid human error.

Combine blue/green with deployment guardrails: pre-cutover smoke tests, canary validations for a subset of traffic, and feature flags to control new behavior per customer segment. Ensure database migrations are handled carefully — prefer backward-compatible schema changes or migration strategies that avoid blocking rollbacks (for example, expand-then-contract patterns).

Operationalize the approach with runbooks for cutover, clear rollback criteria, and rehearsals (chaos drills or dry runs) so teams practice the cutover path. Measure the deployment’s success with SLA metrics, rollback frequency, and time-to-recover. When used thoughtfully, blue/green deployments make migrations predictable, reversible, and safer for customers.
