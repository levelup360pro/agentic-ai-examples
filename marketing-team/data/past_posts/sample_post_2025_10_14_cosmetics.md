Double-cleansing is useful when removing sunscreen or makeup. Start with an oil or balm cleanser to dissolve sebum and residues, then follow with a gentle water-based cleanser to remove impurities. This method avoids over-scrubbing while ensuring pores arenâ€™t clogged by residual products. For light makeup days, a single gentle cleanse may suffice. When done thoughtfully, double-cleansing leaves skin clean and prepped for treatments.
