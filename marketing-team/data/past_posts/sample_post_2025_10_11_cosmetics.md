# Post Content

Probiotic and postbiotic skincare aim to support a balanced microbiome rather than sterilize it. Fermented extracts and microbial metabolites can calm inflammation and strengthen barrier function. Pair microbiome-supporting formulas with ceramides and niacinamide for complementary benefits. While research continues, many users report reduced redness and more even texture. Choose products with clear ingredient explanations and avoid harsh preservatives that undermine microbiome benefits.
