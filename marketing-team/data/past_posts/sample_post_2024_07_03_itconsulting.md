Observability is essential, but it’s also a cost center — make it strategic. Start by prioritizing metrics and traces that map directly to business outcomes: error rates, request latency, throughput and key user journey metrics. Reduce noise by sampling high-volume traces and instrumenting only the service boundaries that provide diagnostic value.

Design retention and storage tiers intentionally: keep high-fidelity traces for short windows to support incident response, and aggregate or roll up metrics for longer-term trend analysis. Apply retention policies aligned to compliance needs and postmortem value — not simply a single retention setting across everything.

Use alerting thresholds driven by customer impact and historical baselines rather than fixed numbers, and integrate observability with runbooks so alerts connect directly to remediation steps. Consider cost-saving tactics like adaptive sampling, index-on-write for searchable logs, and archive-to-cheaper storage for older data. Finally, educate teams on what to instrument and why: clear observability ownership and standards reduce redundant telemetry and keep costs predictable while preserving the signal you need to run resilient systems.
