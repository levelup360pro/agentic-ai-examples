# Post Content

API versioning is a stability contract between teams — do it deliberately. Prefer semantic, incremental versioning and provide explicit deprecation timelines so consumers can plan migrations. Avoid breaking consumers by designing for backward compatibility: additive changes first, followed by a well-communicated deprecation window for breaking changes.

Use consumer-driven contract tests to validate compatibility across services and automate these checks in CI to prevent regressions. Where URL-based versioning is required, keep gateway routing consistent and centralize version mapping to reduce duplication. Alternatively, use content negotiation or header-based versioning for more flexible evolution, but document the chosen approach and keep examples for clients.

Provide migration guides and adapters where practical, and run periodic compatibility reports to identify long-lived deprecated versions worth sunsetting. Monitor client usage per version and align deprecation timing with actual usage to avoid disrupting active consumers. API governance — a lightweight registry, clear docs, and automated compatibility testing — reduces friction and keeps integrations healthy as services evolve.
