Exfoliation brightens and smooths when done gently. Chemical options like low-percentage AHAs or PHAs offer mild resurfacing with less irritation than abrasive scrubs. Start with once-weekly use and increase to two or three times weekly only if skin tolerates it. Always follow exfoliation with hydration and daytime SPF to protect newly revealed skin. Avoid layering potent acids with retinoids without professional guidance. Gentle exfoliation helps serums penetrate and gradually refines texture without compromising barrier health.
