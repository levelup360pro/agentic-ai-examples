As seasons shift, so do skin needs. Cooler months often require richer moisturizers and barrier-supporting ingredients to combat dryness, while warmer months benefit from lightweight textures and increased sun protection. Swap textures graduallyâ€”add an occlusive at night in winter and prefer gel-based hydrators in summer. Monitor your skin for tightness or scaling as signals to adjust. Small, seasonal tweaks keep skin comfortable and balanced year-round.
