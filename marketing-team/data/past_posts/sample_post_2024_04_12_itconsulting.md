# Post Content

Structured, parseable logs unlock fast troubleshooting and reliable observability at scale. Include rich contextual fields — request IDs, timestamps, service and environment tags, and key user or transaction identifiers where permitted — so you can correlate events across distributed systems. Prefer JSON or a similarly structured format that ingestion pipelines parse reliably, and avoid dumping large, unstructured text blobs that are hard to query.

Adopt consistent log levels and a pragmatic sampling strategy to control cost while retaining signal for alerts and postmortem analysis. Centralize log aggregation with retention policies appropriate to compliance needs and operational value. Ensure sensitive data is redacted at the source to meet privacy obligations and avoid accidental leaks.

Instrument logs with business and technical markers to support both development diagnostics and product analytics. Combine logs with traces and metrics for a complete observability picture: logs answer the “what” and “why” when traces show the “how” and metrics show the “how much.” Finally, automate alerting for common failure patterns and document runbooks that map log signals to investigation steps — this turns raw logging into operational muscle that speeds recovery and reduces toil.
