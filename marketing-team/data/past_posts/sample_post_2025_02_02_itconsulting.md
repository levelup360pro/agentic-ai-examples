API gateways centralize cross-cutting concerns — authentication, authorization, rate limiting, and observability — while keeping business logic inside services. Design your gateway layer to enforce consistent access patterns: validate tokens, propagate authenticated identity to downstream services, and apply request-level quotas that protect backend capacity.

Use the gateway for protocol translation and request shaping when needed, but avoid embedding domain logic that belongs in services. Implement comprehensive observability at the gateway: request latencies, error rates, and per-client usage metrics to detect traffic anomalies and abuse patterns early.

Gateways also enable operational controls like per-tenant rate limits, dynamic routing, and A/B routing for canary rollouts. Ensure the gateway is highly available and test failover paths. Finally, treat gateway configuration as code—version it, review changes, and include it in CI so that gateway behaviors are predictable and auditable. This keeps enforcement centralized without creating a brittle choke point.
