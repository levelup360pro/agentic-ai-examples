Include integration and performance tests as part of migration pipelines — they’re the difference between a smooth cutover and surprise incidents. Build a testing pyramid that covers unit, integration, contract, and performance tests, and run the appropriate subset at each stage of your migration pipeline. Integration and contract tests should validate that dependent services behave the same in the target environment; run them in an isolated pre-production environment that mirrors networking and identity assumptions.

For performance validation, create representative traffic profiles and run them against the migrated stack under realistic data and concurrency characteristics. Measure latency percentiles, error rates, and resource utilization to identify bottlenecks tied to configuration or cloud sizing. Automate canary or blue/green rollouts with these tests gating promotion so you catch regressions before full cutover.

Don’t forget failover and resilience tests: simulate network partitions, degraded downstream dependencies, and instance terminations to confirm service-level behavior and recovery. Capture test outputs and feed them into dashboards and automated alerts so failures surface quickly to engineers. Finally, embed testing ownership into migration plans: assign clear test owners, document pass/fail criteria, and require sign-off for cutover. When testing is systematic, migrations become predictable, safer, and faster to operate.
